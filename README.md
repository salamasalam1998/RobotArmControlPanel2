# RobotArmControlPanel2 
In this I add some more functions to the first task which is creating robot arm control panel. The new features is to implement more control like directions (Forward , left , right ,etc..) and read those value from the database.
I faced some issues related to the style of the interface ,when I implement the new button , the page style was messed up. Therefore I search for some solutions and I tried them , they work perfectly and make the design proper to any platform or device ( such as mobile overview). 
I created another php file (insert2.php) to disply the database values , one table is for the first task and the other one for the second task which specify the selected direction by the user).
I changed the style and make the range sliders smaller that can fit any screen view especially mobile view , I added a command to my header html file for this issue. 
In the first task , when click submit , it reads the value from the database but in this task I make it optional if the user wants to read them , there is a specific file for that (insert2.php). it also improve the efficiency of the program.
also I make the direction buttons as 'submit type' , this means that they are seperable from the engine values . Therefore , when the user click submit to the engine values , the direction still what was previously selected.
When I was facing issues , I was asking our trainers who give the best answers and provide us with some resources to learn , special Thanks to them . We appreciate their help!
I am learning more and more about web development as well as improving my self learning skill and project managment. 
The files are uploaded in this project , html file (index.html) and 2 php files as well as a demo (video ) along with the files.
